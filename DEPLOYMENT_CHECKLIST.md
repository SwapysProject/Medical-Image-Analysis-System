# ðŸš€ Medical Image Analysis System - Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### System Requirements
- [ ] Python 3.7+ installed
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- [ ] At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large images)
- [ ] 2GB free disk space

### File Structure Verification
- [ ] All Python files are present and executable
- [ ] Static files (CSS, JS) are properly linked
- [ ] Templates directory contains HTML files
- [ ] Docker files are configured correctly
- [ ] Test suite runs successfully

### Configuration
- [ ] Update SECRET_KEY in config.py or environment variables
- [ ] Set appropriate file size limits
- [ ] Configure logging levels
- [ ] Set worker counts based on system resources

## ðŸ³ Docker Deployment (Recommended)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone project
git clone <repository-url>
cd medical-image-analyzer

# Build and run
docker-compose up --build

# Access application
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Use production profile with nginx
docker-compose --profile production up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f medical-analyzer

# Scale if needed
docker-compose up --scale medical-analyzer=2
```

## ðŸ”§ Manual Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
python app.py
```

### Production Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 2 --timeout 300 app:app

# Or use the provided script
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### Run Test Suite
```bash
# Basic tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Check specific functionality
python -m pytest tests/test_segmentation.py::TestCellSegmentation::test_segmentation_basic
```

### Health Checks
- [ ] Visit `/health` endpoint - should return healthy status
- [ ] Upload a test image - should process successfully
- [ ] Download results - should generate proper files
- [ ] Check logs for errors

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Memory usage (especially during large image processing)
- CPU utilization
- Disk space (uploads and outputs directories)
- Response times for analysis requests
- Error rates

### Optimization Tips
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Adjust worker counts based on CPU cores
- Implement image compression for large files
- Add Redis for caching if processing many similar images

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Production Security
- [ ] Change default SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper file upload validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Regular security updates

### File Security
- [ ] Validate uploaded file types
- [ ] Scan for malicious files
- [ ] Implement user authentication if needed
- [ ] Regular cleanup of temporary files

## ðŸŒ Accessing the Application

### Local Access
- **URL**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health
- **API Documentation**: Available through web interface

### Features Available
- âœ¨ Drag-and-drop image upload
- ðŸ”¬ Advanced cell segmentation
- ðŸ“Š Comprehensive feature extraction
- ðŸ¤– ML-based classification
- ðŸ“ˆ Statistical analysis and reporting
- ðŸ’¾ Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, Images)
- ðŸ“± Responsive web interface

## ðŸ› Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No module named 'cv2'"
```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

#### "Memory Error" during processing
- Reduce image size
- Lower worker count
- Increase system memory
- Use tile-based processing

#### Port 5000 already in use
```bash
# Find and kill process using port 5000
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:5000 | xargs kill -9

# Or run on different port
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5001
python app.py
```

#### Docker issues
```bash
# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Clean up Docker
docker system prune -a

# Check logs
docker-compose logs medical-analyzer
```

## ðŸ“ž Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor disk space in uploads/outputs directories
- [ ] Check application logs regularly
- [ ] Update dependencies periodically
- [ ] Backup important analysis results
- [ ] Monitor system performance

### Getting Help
1. Check the README.md for detailed documentation
2. Review test cases for usage examples
3. Check logs for error messages
4. Create GitHub issues for bugs or feature requests

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
